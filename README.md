Here we have some items for you to order. We show you a list of items and ask you what you want and how much.
We start bytyping in node bamazonCustomer.js and then the program starts.

View the list and then answer the questions using first the item_number and then how much of that item you would like.

After you place your order then you will be notified of your purchase and how much it costs and you will also see an updated inventory list and can place another order.
